The primary aim of this project is to gather air fare and have the government ready to use data for creating plans for airport competition. The dataset lists airport markets where the origin or destination airport is an airport that has other commercial airports in the same city. The fare and traffic data is developed to provide a basis for the requisite analysis. A section of the dataset provides real life examples of concerns and or information pertaining to U.S. airline service to various U.S. cities, at the end of the project we may gain valuable insights into domestic airfare patterns and potentially identify cost-effective travel options or research trends in airline competition.
We will carefully examine the dataset before starting our research to make sure the data is reliable and intact. This entails looking at the data's origin, the methods used to obtain it, and any biases or constraints that might have an impact on its validity.
We will verify that the dataset's variables align with both our analytical approach and our research objectives. This means confirming the existence of important information needed for our study, like geographic identifiers, demographic characteristics, and poverty rates.
To gain a fundamental understanding of the dataset, we will utilize exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, trends, and outliers. This will help us assess how rich and valuable the data is for our study.
